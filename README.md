Project Overview
RigRadar AI is an autonomous hardware market scanner and PC building assistant. It monitors hardware prices across multiple platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alza, Bazos) 24/7, providing users with real-time deal alerts, market analytics, and AI-driven hardware consultations.

The platform is built using Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and Upstash Redis, leveraging the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for intelligent market analysis and support.

Core Features
1. Autonomous Market Scanner (Radar Control)

Live Monitoring: Continuously intercepts hardware signals from various stores to find the best deals.

Custom Scans: Users can deploy "satellites" to target specific hardware (e.g., "RTX 4080") with filters for price range and condition (New/Used).

Real-time Updates: Uses Pusher for instant UI updates when new deals are intercepted.

2. AI Hardware Advisor (Workspace)

PC Upgrade Consultation: Specialized AI chat trained to analyze user PC specs (CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU) to identify bottlenecks and suggest optimal upgrades.

Technical Precision: Provides objective, technical advice on power supply sufficiency and hardware compatibility.

Integrated Scanning: The AI can suggest exact terms to use in the Radar Control for part-specific hunting.

3. Market Analytics & Predictive Tools

AI Verdict: Every deal is assigned a "Value Score" and expert commentary generated by Gemini.

Predictive Forecaster: Provides "Buy Now," "Wait/Hold," or "Overpriced" signals based on historical data.

Price History Charts: Visualizes market trends using Chart.js to help users identify the best time to buy.

4. Frankenstein Build of the Day

Daily Builds: A cron job (running daily at 08:00) that selects the cheapest functional parts from the global history to create a "Frankenstein Build".

Witty Commentary: Generated with a "Mad Scientist" personality to provide entertaining yet functional budget PC configurations.

Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js.

Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js).

Database: Upstash Redis (Key-Value and Hash storage for sessions, history, and scans).

AI Engine: Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash).

Payments: Stripe integration for Premium subscription management.

Authentication: Multi-method login via Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, and custom Email/Password.

API & Infrastructure
The repository includes several serverless endpoints located in the /api directory:

auth.js: Handles session generation and OAuth callbacks.

scans.js: Manages scan requests, saving deals to the archive, and enforcing limits.

update_price.js: Central hub for fetching latest deals, history, and system status.

support.js: Concierge bot for technical help and pricing questions.

export.js: Generates CSV exports for Premium users.

Security
HttpOnly Cookies: Sessions are managed via secure cookies to prevent JavaScript-based token theft.

Rate Limiting: Anti-spam protection implemented for support and chat functions using Redis counters.

Sanitization: All search queries and messages are sanitized to prevent prompt injection and XSS.
