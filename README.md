## ✨ Core Features

### 🔍 Autonomous Market Scanner (Radar Control)
* **Live Monitoring:** Continuously intercepts hardware signals from various stores to find the best deals in real-time.
* **Custom Satellites (Watchdogs):** Deploy background trackers targeting specific hardware (e.g., "RTX 4080 Super") with price thresholds and condition filters.
* **Real-time Updates:** Integrated with Pusher for instant UI updates the moment a new deal drops.

### 💬 AI Hardware Advisor (Workspace)
* **Expert Consultation:** A specialized AI chat assistant trained to analyze your current PC specs (CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU), identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimal upgrades.
* **Visual Diagnostics:** Upload images of components or error screens for the AI to analyze and troubleshoot.
* **Integrated Scanning:** The AI can directly suggest exact search terms to plug into the Radar Control.

### 📊 Market Analytics & Predictive Tools
* **AI Verdict:** Every intercepted deal receives a "Value Score" (0-100%) and expert commentary generated by Gemini.
* **Predictive Forecaster:** Provides market signals ("Buy Now," "Wait/Hold," or "Overpriced") based on historical data.
* **Price History Charts:** Visualizes market trends using Chart.js to help you time your purchases perfectly.
* **Hardware Battle:** Compare two components head-to-head to see which offers better performance and value for your specific use case.

### 🧟‍♂️ Frankenstein Build of the Day
* **Daily Builds:** An automated cron job that selects the cheapest functional parts from the global history to create a daily "Frankenstein Build."
* **Witty Commentary:** Curated by the AI's "Mad Scientist" persona, providing entertaining yet functional budget PC configurations.
